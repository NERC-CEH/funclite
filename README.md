# funclite
Many Python 3.x "quality of life" style wrappers for use across common tasks.

# Intro
My ongoing place to dump code which is reuseable. The majority of modules should be relatively bug free, particularly in iolib.py and baselib.py.
These modules have seen a lot of use over time. Ofcourse bugs will still exist!
<br><br>
# Documentation
Ongoing process to update docstrings to Google Docstring standard. Doing on an adhoc bases.
I'll try and get around to summaries for each module here. But don't hold your breath.
